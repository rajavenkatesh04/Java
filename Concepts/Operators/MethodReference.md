The `::` syntax is known as the **method reference** operator in Java. It provides a shorthand for referring to methods or constructors without having to call them explicitly. Method references can make your code more concise and readable.

### In Your Example:

```java
numbers.replaceAll(doubleNumber::apply);
```

Here, `doubleNumber::apply` is a method reference that refers to the `apply` method of the `doubleNumber` function. It is equivalent to the lambda expression `num -> doubleNumber.apply(num)` but more concise.

### How It Works:

- `doubleNumber` is a `Function<Integer, Integer>` that takes an integer and returns an integer.
- The `apply` method of `doubleNumber` takes an integer as input and doubles it.
- `doubleNumber::apply` is a method reference to the `apply` method of `doubleNumber`.

### Simplifying the Code:

Without the method reference, your code would look like this:

```java
numbers.replaceAll(num -> doubleNumber.apply(num));
```

### Method References:

There are four types of method references in Java:

1. **Static Methods**:

   ```java
   ClassName::staticMethodName
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   Math::max
   ```

2. **Instance Methods of a Particular Object**:

   ```java
   instance::instanceMethodName
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   myString::toUpperCase
   ```

3. **Instance Methods of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type**:

   ```java
   ClassName::instanceMethodName
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   String::toUpperCase
   ```

4. **Constructors**:
   ```java
   ClassName::new
   ```
   Example:
   ```java
   ArrayList::new
   ```

### In Your Case:

- `doubleNumber` is an instance of `Function<Integer, Integer>`.
- `apply` is the method defined in the `Function` interface.
- `doubleNumber::apply` is a method reference to `apply` method of the `doubleNumber` instance.

Method references provide a neat and compact way to express lambda expressions by reusing existing methods.
