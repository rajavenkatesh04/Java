### **What Qualifies as Intermediate-Level Java Knowledge? edit**

#### **Core Java Concepts**
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Solid understanding of OOP principles: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction.
   - Use of interfaces and abstract classes effectively.

2. **Collections Framework:**
   - Familiarity with `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and their common implementations (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.).
   - Ability to use generics (`List<String>`, `Map<Integer, String>`).
   - Sorting and searching collections with `Comparator` and `Comparable`.

3. **Java 8+ Features:**
   - Lambda expressions and functional interfaces.
   - Stream API for data manipulation (e.g., filtering, mapping, reducing).
   - `Optional` for handling null-safe values.

4. **Exception Handling:**
   - Writing try-catch-finally blocks and understanding exceptions hierarchy.
   - Creating custom exceptions.
   - Best practices for error handling.

#### **Advanced Java Features**
5. **Concurrency:**
   - Basics of multithreading (`Thread` and `Runnable`).
   - Using `ExecutorService` for thread pooling.
   - Understanding synchronization, locks, and thread safety.

6. **Input/Output (I/O):**
   - Working with files (`File`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`).
   - Serialization and deserialization.

7. **JDBC:**
   - Connecting to databases using JDBC.
   - Executing SQL queries and handling `ResultSet`.

#### **Development Tools**
8. **Build Tools:**
   - Knowledge of Maven or Gradle for dependency management and project builds.

9. **Testing:**
   - Writing JUnit tests.
   - Mocking frameworks like Mockito for testing.

#### **Design and Coding Practices**
10. **Design Patterns:**
    - Familiarity with patterns like Singleton, Factory, Builder, and Observer.

11. **Clean Code:**
    - Writing maintainable and readable code (following SOLID principles).

#### **Framework Awareness**
12. **Servlets/JSP (Optional but Good to Know):**
    - Basic understanding of Java web development.

### **Checklist to Test Your Knowledge**
If you can:
- Build a small application like a To-Do List or Library Management System using Java.
- Work with an SQL database to store/retrieve data.
- Write and test code using Maven/Gradle with JUnit.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and understand Java 8+ features.

...you are likely at an **intermediate level**.
